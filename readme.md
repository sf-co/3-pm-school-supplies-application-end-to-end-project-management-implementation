# School Supplies Application – End-to-End Project Management Implementation

```
The School Supplies Application project is a comprehensive digital solution designed to streamline the purchasing, inventory management, and distribution of school supplies for K-12 institutions. The platform includes a mobile application (iOS and Android), an admin web panel, supplier API integrations, inventory management functionality, and a customer support system. The project was executed within a fixed budget of $1,000,000 and a six-month timeline (01/01/2024 – 06/01/2024), aligning with the academic calendar. It aims to reduce school procurement time by 25%, improve user satisfaction by 20%, and digitally transform supply chain management for educational institutions. The solution incorporates vendor integration, secure transaction management, stakeholder engagement, risk mitigation strategies, and structured quality assurance processes to ensure successful delivery and adoption.

This project demonstrates full lifecycle project management execution, with 116 comprehensive deliverables completed, covering integration, scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk, procurement, stakeholder, communication, and resource management. Key artifacts include the Project Charter, Scope Management Plan, WBS, Gantt Chart, Risk Register, Earned Value Management reports, Monte Carlo Simulations (qualitative and quantitative risk analysis), Quality Assurance and ISO 9001-aligned standards, UAT documentation, Agile frameworks (Scrum, Kanban, Product Backlog, Sprint Planning, Burndown/Burnup Charts), stakeholder analysis, procurement activities, cost performance reporting (EAC, ETC, TCPI), and full project closure documentation including lessons learned and postmortem reports. The project integrates both predictive (waterfall) and Agile methodologies, ensuring governance, transparency, performance monitoring, and continuous improvement while delivering a scalable, high-quality digital education supply management platform.
